# Persona IM Maker
This project's idea is **stolen** (Phantom Thieves should steal things) from https://github.com/chris-horner/Persona-IM, 
I just make it multiplatform and configurable for users.


"Maker" is from super mario maker.

I don't have other devices, so I only test the project on my Windows.
